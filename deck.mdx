## ...What?

---
# Kidding
(Mostly)

---
# Coverage != Quality

---
## Examples
```ruby
def test_excel_endpoint
  get :excel_single, company_id: @company.id, report: 'exit_distributions'

  assert_equal(response.status, 200)
end
```

# Clarify

---
# Coverage is Coverage
Something is better than nothing
